            <p>
                I'm an expert front-end web developer, specializing in 
                <strong class='red'>interactive and animated</strong> web apps. I pride myself on writing 
                <strong class='orange'>efficient</strong>,

                <strong class='green'>testable</strong>, and 
                <strong class='blue'>well-documented</strong>

            </p>
            <p>    
                I'm proficient in 
                <strong class='red'>JavaScript</strong>,

                        <h3>Tripod Fertility - 3D WordPress Homepage</h3>
                        <p>I created this responsive 3D homepage, found at <a href="https://www.tripodfertility.com/" target="_blank">tripodfertility.com</a>, based on client designs, using Three.js, Blender, Inkscape, and GIMP. The spinning logo and cityscape are extruded SVGs. The other assets were purchased, then I modified and posed for them for the scene. Finally, I integrated the page into the client's WordPress site, prioritizing good SEO and easy content editing.</p>

                        <h3>Interactive SVG map</h3>
                        <p>To demonstrate changes to this <a href="https://vbz-limmattal.mxm.ch/" target="_blank">Swiss transit system</a>, I made the given SVG graphic interactive and animated, and created the UI and sidebar that displays the details of each train line. This microsite is embedded in an iframe on the main site, is responsive, and works with both mouse and touch controls.</p>

                        <h3>OBJ Love Shopify Store - 3D Galaxy</h3>
                        <p>I worked with a team to create this Shopify store for NFL player Odell Beckham Jr. My responsibilities were to take the designer's static 2D image of the galaxy logo, create a 3D model of it using Blender, and animate it using three.js. I also implemented the interactivity with the 3D graphic, the swipe navigation for the homepage's content, and the custom cursor. This site is designed for both desktop and mobile.</p>
