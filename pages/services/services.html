                        <p>I created this responsive 3D homepage, found at <a href="https://www.tripodfertility.com/" target="_blank">tripodfertility.com</a>, based on client designs, using Three.js, Blender, Inkscape, and GIMP. The spinning logo and cityscape are extruded SVGs. The other assets were purchased, then I modified and posed for them for the scene. Finally, I integrated the page into the client's WordPress site, prioritizing good SEO and easy content editing.</p>

                        <p>I worked with a team to create this Shopify store for NFL player Odell Beckham Jr. My responsibilities were to take the designer's static 2D image of the galaxy logo, create a 3D model of it using Blender, and animate it using three.js. I also implemented the interactivity with the 3D graphic, the swipe navigation for the homepage's content, and the custom cursor. This site is designed for both desktop and mobile.</p>
