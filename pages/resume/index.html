                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a freelance software developer with a background in electronics engineering and chemistry. I have a passion for creating things that both look great and work well. I love to learn and develop new skills, and I like to work independently within a collaborative team to produce a quality product. Check out <a class='purple' href='https://sarahrosannabusch.ca/#swPortfolio'>my portfolio</a> to see some of my past work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm originally from Ontario and have lived in Victoria BC since 2009 where I love to cycle, kayak, and play boardgames. Feel free to follow me on <a class='blue' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-rosanna-busch-641ab44a/' target='_blank'>LinkedIn</a> or <a class='orange' href='https://www.instagram.com/annarose0113/' target='_blank'>Instagram</a> if you want to learn a little more about me. And check out my <a class='yellow' href='https://github.com/sarahRosannaBusch' target='_blank'>GitHub</a> account to see some examples of how I code.
