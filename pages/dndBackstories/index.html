                I'm working on a text adventure that is based entirely on the open source <a href='https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules' target='_blank'>D&D Basic Rules</a>. Click the button below to play the two-minute teaser demo to get a feel for how it will work.

                This interactive fiction tells the story of how heros are created in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. You don't need to have any D&D experience to play, just a love of adventure stories. If you're brand new to the game, it will teach you the language and core mechanics. And if you're an experienced player, it will bring you back to basics and give you a little D&D fix between your campaign sessions.
