                This piece of interactive fiction tells the story of how heros are made in the world of <a href='https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules' target='_blank'>Dungeons and Dragons</a>. To play it, you only need a web browser and a love of adventure stories. If you're new to role-playing games that's totally fine, it will give you a feel for how they work. And if you're an experienced player, it will bring you back to basics and give you a chance to play with those cantrips your DM is always poo-pooing.
