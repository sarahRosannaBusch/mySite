            <p>    
                This piece of interactive fiction tells the story of how heros are made in the world of <a href='https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules' target='_blank'>Dungeons and Dragons</a>. All you need to play is a web browser and a love of adventure stories. If you're new to role-playing games, it will give you a feel for how they work. And if you're an experienced player, it will bring you back to basics and give you a chance to use those cantrips your dm is always poo-pooing.
