I'm a freelance web developer specialized in interactive graphics and animation. I also like to write, draw, and make games. This is my portfolio site.

##SITE DESIGN
This site is built for mobile first and follows responsive web design and adaptive javascript principles for best performance and usability on any device or screen-size. 

###STYLES
This site uses Sass to create stylesheets. 

To modify stylesheets, ensure Sass is installed:
`npm install -g sass`

To compile css:
`sass styles.scss styles.css`

Or to auto-compile whenever a .scss file has a new save:
`sass --watch styles.scss:styles.css`
